## Goals
Product & Teamwork

## Process/Project Governance
   - Pairing/solo when required
### StandUP 9:30am
    - Emotional check-in: 1/10 or weather check
    - What I did yesterday / what I'm doing today / any blockers 
### Kanban & Given / When / Then
### Product build & retrospective: 
    - Every 2 days (inc. standup)
### Product Process & code quality:
    - No pushes to master unless peer reviewed 
    - Pushes frequent & often
    - > 95% test coverage required


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### User Story
```
Given I am a job hunter,
When I sign up,
Then I can create a profile

Given I am a signed-up jobhunter,
When I sign up,
Then I have access to my account

Given I am a jobhunter,
When I am signed up,
I can log in

Given I am an employer,
When I visit the website without logging in, 
I can see a wall of jobhuters with an email address to contact

Given I am an employer, 
when I sign up, 
I can search for profiles with keywords

Given I am an employer, 
When I am logged in, 
I can upload jobs

Given I am a jobhunter,
When I finish with the search,
I can log out.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
