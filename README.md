 - No pushes to master unless peer reviewed
 - Pushes frequent & often with
 - Clear commits
 - Testing Approach:
    - [ ] 95% or greater test coverage.
    - [ ] Unit tests:
       - [ ] test one piece of logic.
       - [ ] __fail__ if that logic breaks.
       - [ ] __pass__ if it that logic produces the expected result.
    - [ ] Can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
    - [ ] Every feature is tested from the user's perspective.
