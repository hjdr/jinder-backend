### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### User Stories :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

```
Given I am a job hunter,

Then I can create a profile

Given I am a signed-up jobhunter,
When I sign up,
Then I have access to my account

Given I am a jobhunter,
When I am signed up,
I can log in

Given I am an employer,
When I visit the website without logging in,
I can see a wall of jobhuters with an email address to contact

Given I am an employer,
when I sign up,
I can search for profiles with keywords

Given I am an employer,
When I am logged in,
I can upload jobs

Given I am a jobhunter,

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Testing
- [ ] 95% or greater test coverage.
- [ ] Unit tests:
  - [ ] test one piece of your own logic.
  - [ ] fail if that logic breaks.
  - [ ] pass if it that logic produces the expected result.
- [ ] You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
- [ ] Every feature is tested from the user's perspective.


### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
